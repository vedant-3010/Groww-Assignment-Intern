# GrowwMedia  [Website](https://groww-assignment-intern.vercel.app/):


## Project Overview
This Next.js web application, named GrowwMedia, is a photo-sharing web app with a news feed and profile section using the Unsplash OpenAPI. It fetches random photos for the news feed and allows users to view and interact with user profiles.

## Motivation
The goal was to create a responsive and feature-rich web app that mimics the key functionalities of a photo-sharing app using the Unsplash OpenAPI. The project aims to showcase proficiency in Next.js, Redux, and Redux Toolkit, while also implementing good coding practices and addressing various edge cases.

## Functionalities
1. **News Feed**: Fetches 10 random photos with infinite scroll. Displays user details, 3 resolutions photo URLs, location, likes, and other relevant data points. Implements infinite scroll for a seamless browsing experience. Caches API responses for a certain amount of time to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.

2. **Profile Section**: Clicking on the User Info section redirects to the user's profile page. It fetches user details based on the username from the Unsplash API, displaying all photos in a grid view with descriptions. Users can switch between grid and list views.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: For building a React-based web app with server-side rendering.
- **Redux, Redux Toolkit**: For state management and handling complex application logic.
- **Unsplash OpenAPI**: Used to fetch random photos and user details.
- **Native CSS**: Ensures a responsive and mobile-friendly UI.

## Unique Aspects
The project stands out for its seamless integration of Unsplash's API, dynamic routing, and state management with Redux. It ensures a smooth user experience. The implementation of infinite scroll and caching enhances the application's performance and user interaction.

## Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced Caching**: Improve caching mechanisms for better performance and reduced API calls.
2. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication for personalized experiences.
3. **Optimized UI/UX**: Continuously refine and optimize the UI for an improved user experience.
4. **Error Handling**: Strengthen error handling and provide informative error messages.

## Learnings
- **API Integration**: Gained experience in integrating third-party APIs into a Next.js application.
- **Redux Management**: Learned effective state management using Redux and Redux Toolkit.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented dynamic routing for a more user-friendly navigation experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Mastered the art of creating responsive and mobile-friendly web applications.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Addressed various edge cases to ensure the application's robustness.

## Development Process
1. **Idea Formulation**: Outlined the project's features and functionalities.
2. **Tech Stack Selection**: Choose Next.js, Redux, and Unsplash OpenAPI for the project.
3. **Coding and Testing**: Developed the application incrementally, testing each feature thoroughly.
4. **Error Debugging**: Resolved bugs and errors through systematic debugging.
5. **Documentation**: Maintained comprehensive documentation for easy understanding and future reference.

## Non-Technical Learnings
- **Time Management**: Improved time management skills through structured development phases.
- **Presentation Skills**: Enhanced the ability to present and showcase a project effectively.
- **Documentation Skills**: Learned the importance of well-maintained documentation for codebases.

**Note:** To run the application, you need to create an account on Unsplash, generate an API key, and configure it in the project. Ensure to follow the provided folder structure for clarity and maintainability.
